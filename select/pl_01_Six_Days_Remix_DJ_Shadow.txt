I get a feeling there's gonna be
a riot
I don't read the newspaper is
because they all have is ugly
prints
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's goin'
be shit tonight!
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them
speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day
Tomorrow never comes until it's
too late
(come come come come come with
it)
(come come come come come with
it)
You could be sitting taking
lunch
The news will hit you like a
punch
It's only Tuesday (what time is
it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April fools' day (what time
is it?)
Tomorrow never comes until it's
too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's
too late
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another boom
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another boom
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another boom
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another

tender is to
The heart is cold the gun is

I'm not sure if they feeling
that
I'm not sure if they wanna stop
The gun is cold the blood is

(sha sha sha sha sha sha shot)
The hearts are weak the guns are
not
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday (what time is

You feel the shaking on the
ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday? (what time
is it?)
Tomorrow never comes until it's
too late

Get tomorr' on the phone)
Tomorrow never comes until it's
